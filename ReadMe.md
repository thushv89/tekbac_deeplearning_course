4. cd into the `<project directory>`
5. Install tensorflow as follows
6. If you **do not have a GPU** use: `conda install -n tekbac.deeplearning --yes --file requirements.txt`
7. If you **do have a GPU** use: `conda install -n tekbac.deeplearning --yes --file requirements_gpu.txt`
8. Activate the newly created environment with activate `tekbac.deeplearning`
